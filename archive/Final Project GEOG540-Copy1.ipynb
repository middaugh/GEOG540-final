    "Reports about the impact of prescription opioid epidemic on the US are nearly ubiquitous in today's news. A growing problem since the late 1990s, the Department of Health and Human Servcies was forced to declare the issue a public health emergency (https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html). Understanding and addressing the issue is a complex and daunting task, requiring analysis from multiple perspectives to gain a full picture of the many contributing factors. Many universities have been quick to try and fill this need for multi-faceted analysis;  Indiana University's 'Addictions Grand Challenge'(AGC) is one such program (https://news.iu.edu/stories/2018/11/iu/releases/08-addictions-grand-challenge-phase-two.html).  I am currently serving on project funded by the AGC, \"Opioid Addictions and the Labor Market: Hiring and Training During an Epidemic,\"led by Dr. Kosali Simon (IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs) and Dr. Katy Börner (IU School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering). This project \"aims to explain both the relationship between opioid prescriptions and mortality, and between opioid use and labor force participation\" (Opioid Addictions and the Labor Market: Hiring and Training During an Epidemic Proposal). As my work on the project up to this point has been mostly focused on the relationship between opioid prescriptions and mortality, I decided to focus my paper and analysis on the same question. \n",
    "\n",
    "My aims for this project are: \n",
    "<br>1. Cleaning, tidying, and merging my data. I completed some preliminary cleaning earlier in the semester, but there were still a lot of issues with the data, as well as with my code. I wanted to rewrite my code to make it more easily used by others and to end up with a cleaner dataset.\n",
    "<br>2. Rudimentary exploratory data analysis for Indiana. This includes line graphs and choropleth maps created using Plotly, a data visualizaion library available for Python (built on Dash). \n",
    "<br>3. Regression analysis of the relationship between opioid prescriptions and drug mortality. Dr. Simon has mentioned that the impact of the 2012 reforumlation of prescription opioids (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/informationbydrugclass/ucm338566.htm) \n",

    "To meet the aims outlined above, I chose to focus my energies on the 'cleaning, tidying, and merging' portion of work. There was a lot to do here, so most of the functions & libraries used fall into this area, with a smaller portion in the 'Exploratory Data Analysis' and 'Regression Analysis' sections. My organization structure was code, raw_data, and clean_data into separate sections to keep things tidy. \n",

It was collected by past research assistants for Dr. Simon, and spans the years from 2006-2016. I'm confident that this is an appropriate dataset as it is mentioned in the proposal for the grant and comes from a reputable source. The dataset covers the entire united states. For the cleaning and merging of the data I used the entire dataset, which I then narrowed down to Indiana for the exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. \n",

    "For the Indiana dataset I also utilized data from the United States Board on Geographic Names (https://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm) to get longitude and latitude data from FIPS.
